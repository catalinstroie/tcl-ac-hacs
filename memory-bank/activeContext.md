# Active Context: TCL AC Controller HACS Integration

## Current Work Focus
- Achieved HACS compliance for the integration repository.
- Ensured all metadata, documentation, and structure meet HACS requirements.

## Recent Changes
- Updated `manifest.json` with correct domain, documentation, codeowners, and loggers.
- Removed `.DS_Store` files from the repository.
- Added `README.md` and `info.md` at the repository root.
- Force-pushed all changes to both `main` and `release` branches on GitHub.

## Next Steps
- Verify HACS can now install the integration without compliance errors.
- Monitor for any further feedback from HACS or users.
- Continue development and maintenance as needed.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- All naming (domain, folder, repo) is now consistent: `tcl-ac-hacs`.
- Documentation is up to date and covers installation, configuration, and support.
- All unnecessary files are removed from the repository.

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- Maintain strict HACS and Home Assistant compliance for all future changes.
- Keep documentation and metadata current with each release.

## Learnings and Project Insights
- HACS is strict about domain/folder/repo naming and required documentation.
- Placeholder values in manifest.json can cause compliance failures.
- README.md and info.md are essential for user and HACS validation.
